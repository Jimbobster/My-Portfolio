# My-Portfolio

## Description
My portfolio to showcase the projects I've created. It also contains links to my profile and contact information

### Usage
When you load the page, you'll be shown a header containing links to sections of the page, a brief introduction and a photo of me.

When the links are clicked, then they take you to the section of my portfolio containing the information.

When you click on the work section links, then you are directed to the websites in a different window.

When the page is resized or viewed on other sized devices, then the layout is responsive and adapts.
